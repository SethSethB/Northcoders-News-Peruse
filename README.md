# Northcoders News Peruse

Northcoders News Peruse is a news aggregation and rating site which allows you to:

- Read and post articles based on topic
- Browse articles by user
- Comment on articles
- Vote for (and against!) previously posted articles and comments
- The site allows you to browse as a guest or simulate logging in as one of the existing users

As a guest you are able to post comments and vote on all articles/comments, but you will not be able to post an article or delete your comments!

"Logging in" allows you to post articles as that user, but while logged in you will no longer to be able to vote on any comments/articles by that user. You can however delete comments posted by that username.

The app is live [here](https://seth-nc-news-peruse.herokuapp.com) - hope you enjoy!
